# ISTA 322 - Data Engineering
This class was heavily focused on data cleaning and provided a variety of tools to utilize data.\
In this class I learned useful functions, laungages, and editor tricks.
I completed this project alone, submitting my code, a video explaining my method, and a written report.\
I was able to use Yelp API and data I found on online sources for this project.\
\
In this project I analyzed how restaurants ratings through Yelp API compared to their service ratings through other sources.\
I asked the question does a restaurants Yelp rating coorelate with their service ratings.
